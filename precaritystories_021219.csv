"I raise these #precaritystories not to seek sympathy or blame individuals. I willingly chose each of these because they could get me where I wanted to be. I rejected others that I was unwilling to countenance. Many people have had, and continue to have, it worse."
"I received an incredible amount of support and help in all of this, from colleagues, friends and family. If you recognise one of these #precaritystories please realise that no criticism is aimed at you. The problem is the system."
"More #precaritystories - A fixed term contract that I had to quit a permanent non-academic job for, a big leap into the unknown (especially with two children and a mortgage). I felt very lucky compared to others, but the next 18 months were a stressful extended job interview."
"More #precaritystories - a minor car accident on the way to an interview at a job two hours from our home, getting there shaken up, facing a panel of nine interviewers who each asked one question, and a job that went to a candidate who knew everyone, having been a postdoc there."
"I've been very fortunate with my academic career, yet I still have my #precaritystories. An 'interview' via Skype on a Sunday afternoon for an hourly teaching job starting a few weeks later. A subsequent 24 week module with only a couple of pages of reading list as prep."

@mmcbride84 Tagging @emilytmurray @amrcampop too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sharing my #precaritystories as someone who is now a tenured professor partly to illustrate a) it is possible to get tenure later in life b) it\xe2\x80\x99s evil and unnecessary for universities to treat staff this way for increasing durations
I started a job the day after my mum\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford a period of mourning. As my mother in law died in same year I\xe2\x80\x99d already exhausted my compassionate leave and was on a zero hours by the time of my mum\xe2\x80\x99s death. #UCUstrikeback #precaritystories #ExhaustionRebellion
@JasonPtrDavies @UCL_UCU I\xe2\x80\x99m there in spirit if not in person. Tweeting lots about my former life #casualisation #precaritystories whilst looking after sick kids.

#PrecarityStory #UCUstrikes Research plans &amp; collaborations stalled as the lack of permanent contract meant I was excluded from most funding other than post doc schemes as an applicant or co-applicant. In the meantime I was constantly told I was lucky and should be grateful. 3/3

#PrecarityStory #UCUstrike In my first academic job I had a 10-month contract (Sept-June). The dept kept me on the following year but only thanks to a colleague getting some funding for me to develop some new teaching materials did I have any income in July &amp; August. 1/3
