"I've been very fortunate with my academic career, yet I still have my #precaritystories. An 'interview' via Skype on a Sunday afternoon for an hourly teaching job starting a few weeks later. A subsequent 24 week module with only a couple of pages of reading list as prep."

"Since I\xe2\x80\x99m not marching today, I\xe2\x80\x99ll share another #PrecarityStory: it may seem like a small thing, but being precariously employed has sometimes meant that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to see family, whether I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to go home for milestone events. 1/n"
"Read this #PrecarityStory from Dr Katie. Been working all term and no pay. No accountability from the university. This is what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be on e-claims: no contract, no security, missed pay. #ucustrikesback https://t.co/TAnRIBSm0X"
"#PrecarityStory #UCUstrike Six years ago, I was a casual employee giving a big first-year lecture course. I divided the VC's salary by the number of students in the university, and my own pay for lecturing by the number of students doing the module. The former number was larger."
"Student learning conditions are inextricably linked to staff working conditions. High quality (\xe2\x80\x98Gold\xe2\x80\x99 and 4*) research-led teaching cannot be produced at 3am, especially not on a precarious contract. #PrecarityStory 5/"
"It's my 2nd viva-versary and I'm on strike. I arrived at my current position via homelessness, short-term teaching, institutional ambivalence about late wages, and being physically locked out of my own teaching space. #PrecarityStory #UCUStrike"
"What does it mean to work with no contract? No right to sick pay and a lack of legal protection. ""A zero hours contract would have been better!"" \n\n#PrecarityStory #ZeroHourStory #UCUStrikesBack https://t.co/2gnkXVZbOS"
"This is the experience of our members working either on #ZeroHours or, at times, no contract whatsoever.\n\nFirstly, teaching PGRs across the university working with no contract at all: 'we just get an email'\n#PrecarityStory #ZeroHourStory #UCUStrikesBack https://t.co/z0D5qa0CoM"
#PrecarityStory #UCUstrikes Research plans &amp; collaborations stalled as the lack of permanent contract meant I was excluded from most funding other than post doc schemes as an applicant or co-applicant. In the meantime I was constantly told I was lucky and should be grateful. 3/3
"#PrecarityStory My contract was extended a further year, so I was there 3 years in total. But because of the uncertainty I had to apply for 10s of other jobs &amp; postdocs each year, reducing the time I had to work on publications &amp; making getting those jobs even more difficult. 2/3"
#PrecarityStory #UCUstrike In my first academic job I had a 10-month contract (Sept-June). The dept kept me on the following year but only thanks to a colleague getting some funding for me to develop some new teaching materials did I have any income in July &amp; August. 1/3

"@jobucks @DrJoGrady Time and time again: you claim, say, 40h for November (which is less than you\xe2\x80\x99ve actually worked anyway), and HR simply decide they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you (or care) and pay you for only 25h. #PrecarityStory #UCUStrikesBack 8/n"
"@jobucks @DrJoGrady Oh, on that note: it\xe2\x80\x99s payday today! That always comes with nervous anticipation; not just because we get (maybe) paid, but also because you find out how many hours HR decided not to pay you for. #PrecarityStory #UCUStrikesBack 7/n"

Tomorrow's picket theme is *casualisation* so it's a great time to:\n\n1. follow @UCUAnti_Cas\n\n2. read/contribute to #PrecarityStory\n\n3. look at @ucu's recent report on casualisation in HE (executive summary below) https://t.co/oQ6BYGcn9S https://t.co/n9ezdGobt5
"There is so much inefficiency that comes with precarity. While I was still teaching UGs, the uni cut off my email because they thought I was no longer associated with the uni. I sent rounds of emails and had to go into faculty twice to get it extended. #ucustrike #precaritystory"
Another #precaritystory. They're piling up...\n\nSometimes I've only found out that my contract will be renewed 3 weeks before it's due to end. This means the summer - which should be the best time for research - is wracked with anxiety (1/2)

Classic #PrecarityStory moments.

Amazingly contract appeared that week #UCUstrike
"Great turnout for the rally. Casualisation means uncertainty, it means exhaustion, it means juggling multiple jobs to scrape by, but being treated as if you're not really staff. #UCUStrikesBack #UCUstrikes #UCUstrike #WeWouldRatherBeTeaching #PrecarityStory https://t.co/PJTB2c81Ge"
